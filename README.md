# Labyrinthe
The Labyrinth project is a Java implementation of a maze-solving algorithm and simulation. It features a prisoner ('D') attempting to escape from a maze ('.') ('#') while avoiding fire ('F'). The maze is represented as a weighted graph, and the prisoner's movement and fire spread are simulated using various algorithms.
